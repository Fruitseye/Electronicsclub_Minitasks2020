# Debugging Phase
**Mechanical Build**
  - If the sliders,joints,pulley smooth,use lubricants
  - Use washers along with bolt and nuts,to make it distribute pressure equally and joints remain strong
  - Check for input Voltage used
  - If the build is not strong with the use of 3D printed designs,move onto use metal parts
  - Using aluminium is better,since there is no problem of rusting
  - Pen need to be fixed rigidly for movement of the pen for neat and clear plotting without any scribbling on the paper.
  - The stability of the machine to sustain the power supply and railings
  
**Electronics**
  - To debug arduino code and GCode Parser code,using Serial communication helps us
  - If Arduino UNO board is giving technical glitches,replace it with Arduino Leonardo board
  - If the plotter is not working,just try to change the image to be drawn.If it works problem sorted...otherwise proceed with debugging
  again...!!!
  
  Most of the mechanical parts are tiny in size.Handle with care...\
  And follow the debugging done in Self_balancing_robot project as well
